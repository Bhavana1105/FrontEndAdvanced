1)Different types of selectors:
  Universal selectors
  Element Seleectors
  Class Seleectors
  ID Selectors
  Attribute Selectors
  Group selectors
  Compound Selectors
  Descendant Selectors
  Parent-child Selectors
  General sibling selectors
  Adjacent sibling selectors
  Pseudo class Selectors
  Pseudo Element selectors



2)CDN:
A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos. 


3)this and $(this) refers to the same element. The only difference is the way they are used. 'this' is used in traditional sense, when 'this' is wrapped in $() then it becomes a jQuery object and you are able to use the power of jQuery.
$(this) is a jQuery object and you can use the power and beauty of jQuery, but with 'this' keyword, one need to use native JavaScript.


4)A page can't be manipulated safely until the document is "ready." jQuery detects this state of readiness for you. Code included inside $( document ).ready() will only run once the page Document Object Model (DOM) is ready for JavaScript code to execute. Code included inside $( window ).on( "load", function() { ... }) will run once the entire page (images or iframes), not just the DOM, is ready.

6)attaching one time events in jQuery:

The one() method attaches one or more event handlers for the selected elements, and specifies a function to run when the event occurs.

When using the one() method, the event handler function is only run ONCE for each element.
Syntax
$(selector).one(event,data,function)

7)https://api.jquery.com/text-selector/#:~:text=%24(%20%22%3Atext%22%20)%20allows,%22*%22%20)%20is%20implied.
$( ":text" ) allows us to select all <input type="text"> elements. As with other pseudo-class selectors (those that begin with a ":") it is recommended to precede it with a tag name or some other selector; otherwise, the universal selector ( "*" ) is implied.
